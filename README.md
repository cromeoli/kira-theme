## About it

Living vibrant elements over the cyberspace void.

Kira is inspired by [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) and cyberpunk vibes generally. Also inspired by *William Gibson - Neuromancer* novel.

Kira Theme is a dark theme for VSCode designed with both an aesthetic and functional approach. Its colour palette is based on the idea of cyberspace, with a deep black background representing emptiness and an interface in shades of blue symbolising the coldness of machines.

### Main features:

- ðŸŽ¨ **Optimised Kira Palette**: Kira has been created using the eponymous â€˜Kira Color Paletteâ€™ colour palette of cool colours and pure black tones representing living code over the void of cyberspace.

- ðŸ“œ **Design for readability**: Designed to quickly associate each element of the code to a colour with a logical basis, avoiding red colours that we could unconsciously associate to errors or mistakes. *Blue* for functions and variables (high degree of abstraction). *Green* for strings (usually the most human element of the code) and *pink* for numbers (concrete representations).

- ðŸ“Ÿ **Immersive interface**: Representing a window into cyberspace, the colours of *Kira* have been intentionally selected to immerse you in a cyberpunk night when programming.

- ðŸŒ™ **Less eyestrain**: Based on a balanced dark scheme with vibrant and contrast-calibrated colors (Using [Coolors Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)) for long coding sessions.

This theme represents my vision of the code, imbued by personal aspects such as my love for cyberpunk and the retro-futuristic vision of technology as depicted in sci-fi/action films like *Robocop*, *Demolition Man* or *Johnny Mnemonic*, which so deeply touched me.
